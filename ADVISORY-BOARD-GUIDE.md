### Step 1: Locate the Section
Open `index.html` and find the **Advisory Board Section** (around line 327).

Look for this placeholder structure:

```html
<!-- Advisory Board Member 2 - PLACEHOLDER: Add your second advisory member here -->
<div class="advisory__member">
    <div class="advisory__photo" aria-hidden="true">        
      <span class="material-icons advisory__placeholder">person</span>                                                                      
    </div>
    <h3 class="advisory__name">Coming Soon</h3>
    <p class="advisory__role">Industry Expert</p>                            
    <p class="advisory__bio">

    </p>
    <span class="advisory__linkedin advisory__linkedin--placeholder">Profile Coming Soon</span>                                                                     
</div>
```

Replace with your member's information:

```html

    <div class="advisory__photo" aria-hidden="true">        
      <span class="material-icons advisory__placeholder">person</span>                                                                      
    </div>
    <h3 class="advisory__name">John Smith</h3>

## Adding More Than 3 Members

If you need more than 3 members, simply copy a complete member block and add it inside the `.advisory__grid` div.

The grid automatically adjusts based on screen size:
- **Desktop**: 4 columns
- **Tablet**: 2 columns  
- **Mobile**: 1 column

## Optional: Adding Photos

To add actual photos instead of the placeholder icon:

1. Save the photo in `assets/images/advisory/`
2. Replace the icon div with an img tag:

```html
<div class="advisory__photo">
    <img src="assets/images/advisory/member-name.jpg" alt="Member Name">
</div>
```

Make sure photos are:
- Square (1:1 aspect ratio)
- At least 200x200 pixels
- Optimized for web (JPG or WebP)
